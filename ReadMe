Hey i am trying to implement THE RSA KEYS Algo in Javascript, just for fun


// Won't work with letters above m,  because a = 1, m = 13 and phin = 14.
// Didnt find a solution for now, might be due to the int limit of javascript

// Checkout how to get Phinn in explanation.js


/ This could be the line of code to get d but
// let d =
//   decryptionsKeys[Math.floor(Math.random(0, 1) * (decryptionsKeys.length - 1))];

// But since Javascript Int are limited, we'll use the lowest value possible of d atm
